# Plots

The following code generates the plots and figures presented in [1]. Figure 1 is a drawing that is generated using an online drawing tool, and so is not included here. Use the following code to generate figures 2-5.

## Figure 2

Figure 2 shows the results of the two algorithms, as well as the comparison to
the dynamic programming results. The first plot shows the dynamic programming
results, the second shows the results from the `KernelDistributionEmbeddings`
algorithm. The third shows the absolute error between the dynamic programming
results and the results from `KernelDistributionEmbeddings`. The fourth shows
the results from `KernelDistributionEmbeddingsRFF`. The fifth shows the absolute
error between the dynamic programming results and the results from
`KernelDistributionEmbeddingsRFF`.
